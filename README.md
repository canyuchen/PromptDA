The code for **PromptDA: Label-guided Data Augmentation for Prompt-based Few-Shot Learners**, which has been accepted to **EACL 2023**. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09229)


# Basic Idea

The basic comparison of conventional data augmentation methods *Synonym Substitution* and our proposed augmentation framework *PromptDA*. $\{\texttt{good, great, fine}\}$ are the label words for prompt tuning. Conventional DA constructs *instances* for augmentation, but PromptDA constructs *instance-label pairs* for augmentation.
