the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .	1
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .	1
decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	1
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	1
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .	1
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .	1
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .	1
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong .	0
its quiet .	0
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .	0
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .	0
