1,"great camera , great investment ! ."

1,this one is really great .
1,"there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it ."

1,all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .
1,sound quality ? . phenomenal .
0,"basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
0,the user support service isn 't too great either .
0,"1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet ."
0,norton support is completely pathetic .
0,especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
0,do not buy any home version of norton anything .
0,2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
0,"i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough ."
