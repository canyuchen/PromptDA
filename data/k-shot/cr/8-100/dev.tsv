i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .	1
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .	1
works pretty well .	1
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	0
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .	0
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
