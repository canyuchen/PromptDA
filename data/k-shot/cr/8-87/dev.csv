1,i love this product ! .
1,another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .
1,"the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard ."
1,i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
1,"first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc ."
1,"the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality ."
1,"also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything ."
1,"the sound is quite good , in terms of volume ."
0,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
0,i am glad that i do not work for norton .
0,"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works ."
0,"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button ."
0,3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .
0,"we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party "" asking "" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks ."
0,"if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version ."
0,"as a loyal customer of norton/symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) ."
