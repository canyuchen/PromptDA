directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .	0
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .	0
an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .	0
in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	0
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .	0
too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .	0
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	0
despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .	1
though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .	1
the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat .	1
a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor .	1
i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone .	1
if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on .	1
